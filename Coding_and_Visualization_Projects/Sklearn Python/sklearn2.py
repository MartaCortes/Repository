# Import some libraries:

import numpy as np
from numpy.random import randint
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.base import TransformerMixin


# Create a random matrix with some NA values:

# In[7]:


data=np.array([1,10,np.NaN,50,4,np.NaN,12,6,-2,np.NaN,22,41,np.NaN,33,np.NaN,-5,np.NaN,0,-25,-17,1,-1,np.NaN,0,np.NaN,2,5,6,7,2,9,1])

X=(data.reshape(8,4))

y=X[:,3]
y


# Defining the new transformer:
# 
# Some times you want to preprocess data in order to work better with it and the operation you need to compute is not in the pipeline.
# 
# Then, you can create your onwn pre-process, programing your own transformer function.
# 
# In this case, we want to replace the NAs with a random number which follows a normal distribution with parameters column mean and column standard deviation of the matrix.
# 
# the '.fit' function is the operation that trains the transformer, and the '.transformer' function is the operation that transform the data.

# In[8]:


class no_nas(TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
     
    def fit(self,X,y=None):
        self.mean_ = np.nanmean(X,axis=0)
        self.sd_ = np.nanstd(X,axis=0)
        self.statistics_ = np.random.normal(self.mean_,self.sd_)
        return(self)

    def transform(self, X):
        for j in range(X.shape[1]):
            for i in range(X.shape[0]): 
                if(np.isnan(X[i,j])):
                    X[i,j]=self.statistics_[j]
        return(X)


# Once we have executed the function, we apply it among the matrix defined previously:

# In[9]:


my_nonas_imputer = no_nas()
my_nonas_imputer = my_nonas_imputer.fit(X,y)

print(my_nonas_imputer.statistics_)

XX = my_nonas_imputer.transform(X)
print(XX)


# As we can observed in the result, all of the NAs values have been replaced with the same number for each column.
# 
# We can also use the new transformer in a pipeline:

# In[10]:


from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

knn = KNeighborsRegressor()
qi_knn = Pipeline([('my_nonas_imputer', my_nonas_imputer), ('knn', knn)])

pipe = qi_knn.fit(X,y)
y_pred = pipe.predict(X)

print(y_pred)


# Now, We have a vector with the predictions of the missing values.
#
